title: Merlin Clash - Configuration
---

Merlin Clash is a Clash GUI plug-in that runs on the KoolCenter software center and supports multiple protocols such as SS/SSR/Trojan/V2Ray.
Due to hardware limitations, not all router architectures can run plug-ins normally. Please go to the Merlin Clash official documentation center to check whether the software and hardware version of your router is supported, and go to its official plug-in release channel to install it according to the documentation.

:::tip Notes
**Merlin Clash** and **Scientific Internet** plug-ins cannot be enabled at the same time. Please make sure to completely close or uninstall the original **Scientific Internet** plug-in before configuring and starting the **Merlin Clash** plug-in.

After successful startup, the `plug-in running status` is as shown in the figure below. The node is not selected by default at startup, and the `connectivity check` only detects the current browser status, not the device and plug-in network status.

## acting

After the Merlin Clash plug-in is started, find the `Clash Management Panel` at the bottom of the `Home Page Functions` page.

Through the `Clash management panel`, you can quickly perform common function settings such as `node switching` and `mode change`.
