## Speed up access

Use JsDelivr for free acceleration and add the following custom domain name to the PicGo image bed configuration;

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GitHub username/warehouse name@branch name`

For example: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Theo-messi/pic@master`

### JsDelivr repository exceeds 50M and cannot be accessed. Solution

Add a new branch to the repository after the size exceeds 50M, such as `1.0`

Same as PicGo settings, modify the branch to `1.0`

The accelerated custom domain name is also modified to a new branch

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GitHub username/warehouse name@branch name`
