| `$n`                        | n is a number. This is used during replacement to use brackets ( ) to split the matching pattern into several elements, and then use it in the replaced pattern, similar to a variable. If the search pattern is "(\w+)(\s)(\w+)", then $1 is (\w+), $2 is (\s), $3 is (\w+), and the replacement pattern is $3$2$1, then replace The result is (\w+)(\s)(\w+). Assume that "one two" is matched, then $1, $2, and $3 are "one", " ", "two" respectively, and the result after replacement is "two one". |
