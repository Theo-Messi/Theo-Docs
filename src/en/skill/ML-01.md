---

## ASUS original firmware

ASUS original firmware is the official firmware of ASUS routers, and its code name is Asuswrt. The official firmware can be downloaded from [ASUS Official Download Center] (https://www.asus.com.cn/support/Download-Center/).

Generally, the version number format of ASUS official firmware is: `3.0.0.4.384.9173`, `3.0.0.4.386.41700`

Of course, there are also version numbers similar to this: `9.0.0.4_386_55919`. The firmware version starting with 9.0.0.4 is the official test firmware produced by ASUS.

Generally, it can be downloaded from the ASUS official download center, or from the [Asuswrt section of the Small Net Builder Forum](https://www.snbforums.com/forums/asuswrt-official.51/).

## ASUS official firmware update

Usually what we call **official firmware** refers to **ASUS official firmware**

ASUS official firmware is modified by the kooldev development team (formerly the koolshare forum development team) based on the official source code of the ASUS router. It is the firmware with the software center. The version number is the official firmware version number followed by the `_koolshare` suffix.

> For example, RT-AX86U official firmware version: `3.0.0.4.384_9318_koolshare`.

Compared with ASUS official firmware, the biggest difference between ASUS official firmware and ASUS official firmware is the addition of software center support. It used to be called koolshare software center, but now the latest version is called koolcenter software center. The software center gives the router the ability to freely install plug-ins through

In fact, we are very restrained in the production of official firmware. Our approach is to add software center support with minimal code changes, such as the main program httpdb required for the software center to run, the software center database skipd, and the software center sidebar entrance of the firmware. The software center requires some busybox function support such as xargs, etc. Therefore, in addition to the software center part, the official modified firmware and the official firmware

## Merlin original firmware

The third-party firmware developed by Canadian independent developer Eric Sauvageau on the official ASUS source code is code-named Asuswrt-Merlin. Compared with the official ASUS firmware,

The difference is: [These functions](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/blob/master/README-merlin.txt#L64-L135), such as some system repairs, NFS support, AMTM, merlin-addon, support for multiple startup items, etc.

Usually when we talk about **Merlin firmware**, we mean **Merlin original firmware**. The current version number of Merlin original firmware is generally `386.x`, such as: `386.1`, `386.2_6`, Merlin original firmware The download address is: [https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/](https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/)

## G version Merlin firmware

Another developer: gnuton master, based on the original Merlin code, added support for more models ([gnuton master’s source code is here](https://github.com/gnuton/asuswrt-merlin. ng)), I first noticed his project because he made the Merlin firmware of DSL-AX82U.

Later, gnuton master received further support from ASUS in both source code and hardware. Therefore, we have successively made Merlin firmware for TUF-AX5400, RT-AX82U, and ZenWiFi_XT8. Compared with the original Merlin firmware, here I would like to call it **G version Merlin firmware**.

According to the gnuton master's own words: `My builds should support all features available in the original Merlin firmware`.

Therefore, the functions supported by the original Merlin firmware are supported by the G version of Merlin firmware! To sum up, the **G version Merlin firmware** can be regarded as a complement to more models based on the source code Merlin.

## Merlin revised firmware

Merlin revised firmware refers to the revised firmware with software center developed by the koldev development team based on the original Merlin firmware source code, or the G version of Merlin firmware source code. Its version number is consistent with the original Merlin firmware, such as RT -AX86U official firmware version: `386.5_0`.

Compared with Merlin's original firmware, the biggest difference between Merlin's revised firmware is the addition of software center support. It used to be called koolshare software center, but now the latest version is called koolcenter software center! The software center gives the router the ability to freely install plug-ins!

## Netgear transplanted firmware

Netgear models themselves do not support ASUSWRT/Merlin firmware, but because some Netgear models are basically the same as ASUS router hardware, after some modifications to the source code, it is possible to flash and transplant firmware to Netgear firmware. For example, the hardware (CPU, wireless network card) of Netgear RAX80 is the same as that of ASUS RT-AX88U, so the Merlin revised firmware of RAX80 is transplanted based on the Merlin revised firmware of RT-AX88U.

Currently, the Netgear transplanted firmware produced by the kooldev development team is transplanted based on the Merlin modified firmware. For example, RAX80 is transplanted from the RT-AX88U Merlin modified firmware, and RAX50 is transplanted from the RT-AX58U Merlin modified firmware. However, there are exceptions, such as the upcoming Netgear RAX70 transplanted firmware. Because its corresponding ASUS model RT-AX95Q (ZenWiFi AX6600) does not have the support of Merlin’s original firmware, the RAX70 transplanted firmware is from the ASUS RT-AX95Q. Ported from the official source code.

## Flashing terminology

In order to eliminate novices’ doubts during the flashing process, the basic terms of ASUS/Merlin firmware flashing and my own explanation are listed below. I hope it will be helpful to everyone. If you are already clear about the following content, you can skip this part and go directly to the flashing process.

### 1. Firmware double clear

Double clearing is to clear: 1. nvram configuration, 2: JFFS partition file. Many settings of the firmware are stored in nvram, such as dial-up mode, dial-up Internet account and password, wireless network settings, etc.; many files of the firmware are stored in the JFFS partition, such as traffic data stored in traffic analysis, SSL certificates, and UU accelerator programs. wait. Generally, mutual flashing of the same type of firmware does not require double clearing. Mutual clearing of different types of firmware requires double clearing as appropriate to ensure that the router is in the best working condition after flashing.

How to double clear the router: Enter [System Management] – [Restore/Export/Upload Settings], check the selection box next to the restore button, and then click the restore button.

### 2. Factory reset

Restoring to factory settings clears the nvram configuration of the firmware, but does not clear the JFFS partition file. In this way, files such as traffic analysis and SSL certificates will not be lost. It is worth noting that many friends use [Export Settings] to back up the firmware configuration. However, when flashing firmware, especially when different types of firmware flash each other, it is not suitable to use the backup configuration to restore a machine that has just been factory restored. , because this means you have recovered nothing. Therefore, please be sure not to use previously backed up configurations to restore a router that has just been flashed and then restored to factory settings. Using the configuration file backed up by [Export Settings], some settings are generally made that cause problems with the router. After restoring the router to the original factory defaults, then use the backup configuration to restore it. The router will be the same version before and after using the backup configuration.

How to restore factory settings: Enter [System Management] – [Restore/Export/Upload Settings], click the restore button, and remember not to check the selection box to the right of the restore button! !

### Format JFFS

Formatting JFFS means formatting the JFFS partition, which will delete all files stored in the JFFS partition without affecting other configurations of the router. In the Merlin revised firmware, because the Software Center is stored in the JFFS partition, formatting JFFS can quickly clear the Software Center files in the current JFFS partition, thereby resetting the Software Center. Of course, formatting JFFS will also delete some files stored by the firmware in the JFFS partition, such as SSL certificates, traffic analysis data, etc. If you just want to reset the Software Center without damaging the files in other JFFS partitions, you can refer to [Software Center Reset] or [Delete Software Center] in [Important Commands] below.

How to format JFFS: In Merlin/Merlin revised firmware, check `Format JFFS partition at next boot` in [System Management] – [System Settings] (Chinese meaning: Format JFFS partition at next boot)FFS partition), then click `Apply settings on this page`. After success, click the `Restart` button at the top to restart the router. The JFFS partition will be formatted during the router restart process. After the restart is completed, `Format JFFS partition at next boot` will automatically change to No to avoid the JFFS partition being formatted again the next time the router restarts.

### JFFS mount status

The JFFS partition is an important partition for ASUS routers. Because of the read-write nature of this partition, ASUS officials will use it to store some databases, pictures, and even program files. For example, the database of the ASUS router's [Traffic Analyzer traffic analysis] function is stored in the JFFS partition, as well as the online client's customized icon files in the [Network Map], remote access certificate files, etc., are all stored in the JFFS partition. . JFFS partition

Connect to the router backend through SSH and enter the command (if you don’t know how to use SSH to execute commands, you can refer to the [SSH usage] tutorial below): `mount | grep -w /jffs`, if you see something like `/dev/mtdblock9 on Output like /jffs type jffs2 (rw,noatime)` indicates that /jffs is successfully mounted and the mounted device is `/dev/mtdblock9`. Of course, in the Merlin/Merlin revised firmware, you only need to enter the [Tools - Sysinfo] page and you can see the JFFS mounting status in the JFFS column. If the mounting is successful, the JFFS used capacity and total capacity will be displayed. If If it is not mounted, the word _umounted_ will be displayed. Because the Software Center is stored in JFFS, if there is a white blank page after entering the Software Center, generally speaking there is a problem with the mounting of the JFFS partition. If you encounter this situation, you can refer to [Q4: The software center is blank after flashing] in the FAQ section to try to solve it.

### JFFS partition backup/restore

Friends who use Merlin/Merlin modified firmware may know that Merlin firmware has a JFFS partition backup/restore function compared to the official ASUS firmware. Its essence is to package all the files in the JFFS partition and then restore them when needed. This function is especially useful at certain times. For example, after a certain version of firmware is upgraded, the capacity of the JFFS partition is reduced, which will cause the file blocks stored at the back of the JFFS partition to be forcibly cleared, resulting in the loss of files in the JFFS partition and the file loss. damage. Using the JFFS partition backup/restore function, back up the JFFS partition content before each firmware upgrade. After the firmware upgrade, if the JFFS partition content is lost or damaged, you can use the backup to restore it to avoid the above problems. Of course, if it is Merlin's revised firmware, just restoring is not enough, because after the restoration, although the software center-related programs have been restored, the process has not started yet. Restarting the router at this time can make the software center work normally after the restoration. .

## SSH usage

1. **Enable SSH:** In the [System Management]-[System Settings] of the router background, change [Enable SSH] to `LAN only`, set the port number to `22` or other numbers, click on the page Click [Apply settings on this page] below to save changes;
2. **Log in to SSH:** Download SSH software, such as putty ([Official green version putty 0.74 download address](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.74/w64/putty.exe)) , after running, enter the LAN IP address of the router in the Host Name (or IP address), such as: `192.168.50.1` or `router.asus.com`, the port is the port in [SSH Port] in the previous step, if not Change it to `22`, click [Open], if Putty Security Alert pops up, click [Yes]; enter the `login account of the router` after `login as` on the interface, press Enter, and then enter the password: prompt Finally, enter the `router login password` and press Enter (remember: nothing will be displayed when entering the password, just press Enter after entering it) to complete the login.
3. **Type commands:** When typing commands, it is recommended to switch the system input method to English. You can also copy the command and right-click to paste the command. After pasting, press Enter to execute the command.

## Flash preparation

- It is recommended that after downloading the firmware file, check the md5/sha1 check code of the firmware to ensure the integrity of the firmware;
- It is recommended to use the Google Chrome browser on the computer or a Chromium-based browser for the entire flashing process;
- If the USB2JFFS plug-in is used, it is recommended to uninstall the USB mount before flashing, and then mount it after flashing.

## Start flashing

Because of the existence of the rescue mode, the ASUS router cannot be flashed to death. As long as the light is on during the flashing process, any problem that cannot be started can be saved. So no matter what type of firmware or firmware version you are currently in, you can try to upload the firmware directly on the firmware upload page.

If the machine can be flashed normally, perform a firmware double clear after success to achieve the effect of a clean flash.

If you can't flash the phone, or the phone becomes bricked, the rescue mode can be done in minutes!
