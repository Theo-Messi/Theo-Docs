## Preface

Before setting up, please confirm whether your optical modem supports bridging and whether it supports obtaining the bandwidth account and password. You can consult the master who installed the optical modem or the business office for the broadband account password. The tutorial in this article demonstrates that it supports OpenWrt and Lede. The third-party soft routing on the market is just an interface. Different, but the steps are the same. You can refer to the tutorial below to set up PPPOE dial-up.
