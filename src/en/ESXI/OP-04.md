## 1. Flash the firmware into the virtual machine in ESXi

As you can see, it is only 120.5MB, which is indeed too small. At this time, do not start OpenWRT.

Directly on the hard disk, change the capacity as much as you want, then save and start OpenWRT.

## 2. Install the software and log in to OpenWRT via ssh:

```bash
opkg update && opkg install cfdisk fdisk lsblk block-mount
```

Or you can install them one by one in the software package, and then restart after installation.

## 3. Use the command `cfdisk` to create the extra space just now, enter: `cfdisk`

The following interface will appear, green Free Space, use the keyboard to select up and down, press Enter, create, write, and exit.

## 4. There will be one more /dev/sda3 space. This is the newly created space.

## 5. Format the newly created space: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3

## 6. Enter the mount point and create a new mount.

## 7. Just mount the newly created one to the overlay and restart. If you are using ESXi, please click restart in Openwrt. Do not turn off the power and restart in ESXi.
