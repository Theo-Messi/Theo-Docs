## Step 2

- You are not logged in at this time (**It is recommended to use the SMS verification code to log in**). If you are already logged in, please ignore this step.
- Use the SMS verification code to log in (the cookie is valid for about 31 days in this way, other login methods are shorter)

## Step 6

- copy cookies
- The copied cookie is relatively long, we only need `pt_pin=xxxx;` and `pt_key=xxxx;`
- part of the content is enough (note: English quotation marks `;` are necessary). You can use the following script. Press F12 in the Chrome browser. Enter the following script in the console and press enter.

```bash
    var CV = 'Put the complete cookie obtained in step 6 inside the single quotes';
    var CookieValue = CV.match(/pt_pin=.+?;/) + CV.match(/pt_key=.+?;/);
    copy(CookieValue);
```

The key cookies sorted out in this way are already on your clipboard and can be pasted directly.

:::tip
If you need to obtain the cookie of the second Jingdong account, do not log out of the previous browser (otherwise the cookie obtained just now will be invalid)
You need to change another browser (Chrome browser `ctr+shift+n` to turn on incognito mode), and then continue to follow the above steps.
