## Version

### Docker

- `latest` image is built based on `alpine`,
- `debian` image is built based on `debian-slim`.
- If you need to use dependencies that are not supported by `alpine`, it is recommended to use the `debian` mirror

```sh
docker pull whyour/qinglong:latest
docker pull whyour/qinglong:debian
```

### npm

- `npm` version supports `debian/ubuntu/centos/alpine` system
- Need to install `node/python3` by yourself

```sh
npm i @whyour/qinglong
```

## Deployment

### Docker

```sh
# curl -sSL get.docker.com | sh
docker run -dit \
  -v $PWD/ql/data:/ql/data \
  # 5700 after the colon is the default port. If QlPort is set, it needs to be consistent with QlPort.
  -p 5700:5700 \
  # The deployment path is optional and must start and end with slashes, such as /test/
  -e QlBaseUrl="/" \
  # The deployment port is not required. When using host mode, you can set the port after the service is started. The default is 5700.
  -e QlPort="5700" \
  --name qinglong \
  --hostname qinglong \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  whyour/qinglong:latest
```

### Docker-compos

```sh
#  curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.16.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
mkdir qinglong
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyour/qinglong/master/docker/docker-compose.yml

# start up
docker-compose up -d
# stop
docker-compose down
```

### Podman

```sh
# https://podman.io/getting-started/installation
podman run -dit \
  --network bridge \
  -v $PWD/ql/data:/ql/data \
  # 5700 after the colon is the default port. If QlPort is set, it needs to be consistent with QlPort.
  -p 5700:5700 \
  # The deployment path is optional and must start and end with slashes, such as /test/
  -e QlBaseUrl="/" \
  # The deployment port is not required. When using host mode, you can set the port after the service is started. The default is 5700.
