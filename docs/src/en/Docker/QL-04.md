- Modify `RepoFileExtensions="js py"` to `RepoFileExtensions="js py sh ts"` and save;
- Create a new library task or subscription and execute it. Refresh the browser to see the added task;
- Add CK environment variables. Do not write multiple CKs together. Create a new JD_COOKIE variable for each one;
