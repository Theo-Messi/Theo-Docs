## Steps

### Log in to the Qinglong panel and modify the configuration

Qinglong panel, `Configuration file` page.

Modify `RepoFileExtensions="js py"` to `RepoFileExtensions="js py sh"`

Save configuration.

### Add Raku scheduled tasks in the Qinglong panel

Two ways:

#### 1. Subscription management

```yaml
名称：Bilibili
类型：公开仓库
链接：https://github.com/RayWangQvQ/BiliBiliToolPro.git
定时类型：crontab
定时规则：2 2 28 * *
白名单：bili_task_.+\.sh
文件后缀：sh
```

Don't touch anything not mentioned.

After saving, click the Run button to run the library.

#### 2. Scheduled task library

Qinglong panel, `Schedule task` page, `Add task` in the upper right corner, fill in the following information:

```yaml
名称：拉取Bili库
命令：ql repo https://github.com/RayWangQvQ/BiliBiliToolPro.git "bili_task_"
定时规则：2 2 28 * *
```

Click OK.

After saving successfully, find the scheduled task and click the run button to run the library.

If normal, after the library is successfully loaded, bilibili-related tasks will also be automatically added.

### Log in

In the Qinglong scheduled task, click to run the `bili scan code login` task, view the running log, and scan the QR code in the log to log in.

After successful login, the cookie will be saved to Qinglong's environment variables:

首次运行会自动安装dotnet环境，时间久点，之后就不需要重复安装了。

The dotnet environment will be automatically installed when you run it for the first time. As time goes by, you won’t need to install it again.

## Advance version

You can specify a branch when Qinglong pulls the library. The code of the develop branch will be ahead of the default main branch and include new features currently being developed.

Friends who want to experience new features in advance can try switching to the advanced version, but this also means that the stability will be reduced accordingly (actually, it is equivalent to helping me test bugs in internal testing~🤨).

There are two ways:

### Subscription Management

```yaml
分支：develop
白名单：bili_dev_task_.+\.sh
```

Same as above for other options.

### Scheduled task library

Modify the pull library command to `ql repo https://github.com/RayWangQvQ/BiliBiliToolPro.git "bili_dev_task_" "" "" "develop"`

## GitHub Acceleration

When pulling a library, if the server is in China and accessing GitHub is slow, you can add `https://ghproxy.com/` in front of the warehouse address to speed up, such as: `ql repo https://ghproxy.com/https:/ /github.com/RayWangQvQ/BiliBiliToolPro.git "bili_task_"`

## common problem

### Couldn't find a valid ICU package installed on the system

As #266, you need to add the following environment variables to the environment variables of the Qinglong panel:

```yaml
名称：DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT
值：1
```
