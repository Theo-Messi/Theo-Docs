title: Getting started with Docker

## Docker technology introduction

Docker is booming. This is not just a concept of speculation. Docker has indeed solved the pain points of development and shipping costs, such as version relocation and relocation from test environment to pre-release and production environments. It has been widely used in enterprise development and testing. .

- Docker is an open source software project based on the GO language
- Docker allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a lightweight, portable container
- Docker packages the containers and can publish them to any popular Linux machine, and can also be virtualized
- Containers completely use the sandbox mechanism and will not have any interfaces with each other.
- Docker container performance overhead is extremely low, this is the key
- Docker uses the client-server (C/S) architecture model and uses remote APIs to manage and create Docker containers

## Docker application scenarios

1. Web application automated packaging and publishing
2. Automated testing, continuous integration and release
3. Deploy and adjust databases or other back-end applications in a server environment
4. Use Docker to achieve consistency among the development environment, test environment, and production environment

Docker borrows the concept of standard containers. Standard shipping containers ship goods around the world, and Docker runs this model into its own design. The only difference is: containers transport goods, and Docker is transport software.

**The difference between Docker and traditional VM**

Comparison between docker and traditional VM:

1. Startup speed: generally tens of seconds or minutes for vm, seconds or milliseconds for docker
2. Size: vm is generally several G, and docker is only a few megabytes.

## Docker composition

Docker needs to be divided into three parts: `warehouse`, `image` and `container`

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Docker Image     | A Docker image is a template for creating Docker containers. The image is a layered structure based on the joint file system, which is built step by step through a series of instructions.                                                            |
| Docker container | A container is one or more applications that run independently. An image is equivalent to a class and can easily be equivalent to an instance of a class                                                                                               |
| Docker client    | The Docker client uses the Docker API to communicate with the Docker daemon through the command line or other tools                                                                                                                                    |
| Docker host      | A physical or virtual machine used to execute Docker daemons and containers                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Docker daemon    | is a Docker server-side process, responsible for supporting the running of Docker containers and image management                                                                                                                                      |
| Docker warehouse | Docker warehouse is used to save images and can be understood as a code warehouse in code control. Docker Hub provides a huge collection of images for use, and users can also push their local images to the Docker repository for others to download |

### Docker process related operations

**View docker version**

```bash
docker -v
```

**View docker commands**

```bash
docker --help
```

**View docker server and client version details**

```bash
docker version
```

**Start docker**

```bash
systemctl start docker
```

**Close docker**

```bash
systemctl stop docker
```

**Restart docker**

```bash
systemctl restart docker
```

**View docker running status**

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

**Turn off firewall**

```bash
systemctl stop firewalld
```

### docker acceleration

By default, the Docker download image is downloaded from the official website, and the download speed is extremely slow. We can use Alibaba Cloud Accelerator to increase the speed of obtaining the Docker official website image.

1. **Execute directory creation file (please ignore this step if it already exists)**

```bash
touch /ect/docker/deamon.json
```

2. **Modify the file content to**

```cpp
    {
      "registry-mirrors": ["https://v2c6fjn8.mirror.aliyuncs.com"]
    }
```

Note: This URL is copied from the Alibaba Cloud console and is different for each logged in user. Of course you can also use this.

3. **Restart docker service**

```bash
systemctl restart docker
```

### Mirror operation

**View local mirror**

```bash
docker images
```

**Search for images, here we take installing `tomcat` as an example**

<<< ../code/docker.sh

**Find all the mirrors and pull them**

```bash
docker pull image ID #latest version such as: docker pull tomcat
docker pull tomcat:7 #Specify version
```

**Delete image**

```bash
docker rmi container name
```

**If there is a local image, create a container**

```bash
docker create --name=container name image name
```

```bash
Example:
[root@iZbp18425116ezmjdmbdgeZ ~]# docker create --name=myTomcat tomcat
629104460e3fe485649e5784ec0c34f4dcc2277115937a54be00b968dc646510
```

**View container**

```bash
docker ps # Check what is running easily
docker ps -a # View all containers
```

**Run Container**

```bash
docker start myTomcat # start backend can be followed by easy id (first 2-3 digits) or container name
```

**Stop Container**

```bash
docker stop myTomcat
```

**Delete containers that are not running**

```bash
docker rm container id or name
```

**Delete running containers**

```bash
docker -rm -f container id or name
```

**Delete all containers**

```bash
# Stop all containers first
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

# delete
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Related operations of running containers

**View the docker run command to create and start the container**

```bash
docker run --help
Parameters behind docker run
-i # run container
-t # After the container is started, enter the command line
-v # Directory mapping --mount
-d # Daemon process --running in the background
-p #Port mapping If there is tomcat in the container, your local windows wants to access:
# The docker tomcat port number is 8080, and a port 9099 needs to be mapped to the virtual machine.
# Only windows can access http://virtual machine ip:9099
```

**Create the container and enter the command line**

```bash
docker run -it --name=myTomcat2 tomcat /bin/bash
```

**quit**

```bash
exit
```

**After exiting, re-enter the container**

```bash
#Create a guarded container
docker run -id --name=myTomcat2 tomcat
# Enter
docker exec -it myTomcat2 /bin/bash
```

**File transfer between host and docker container**

```bash
1. Create a file on the host machine
touch test.txt

2. Copy the file into the container
docker cp test.txt myTomcat2:/

3. Enter and follow the target
cd /
```

**Copy files from the container to the host**

```bash
touch abc.txt

#Exit the container
exit

# Copy files in the container to the host
docker cp myTomcat2:abc.txt /root
```

### Visit tomcat

```bash
# Start as a daemon process
# -p host port: port 8080 of the application in the container
# war mount host -v host path: container path
docker run -di --name --myTomcat -p 8080:8080 -v /usr/local/tomcat/webapps:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps tomcat

http://Virtual machine ip:9999

  #Put the war package into the mounting directory of the host, refresh the browser directly, and the project page will appear.
# Microservice k8s container-style performance testing
```

### Mirror backup

```bash
docker save -o tomcat.tar image name

# Put tomcat.tar on other computers, and other people will turn it into a mirror.
docker load -i tomcat.tar
```

### Association between containers

```bash
docker run -di --name=tomcat2 -p 8080:8080 --link mysql
```
