### Step 2 - Clear Configuration

:::tip
For first-time configuration, please see step 3. If you have configured it before, it is strongly recommended to "clear the configuration" and then refer to the tutorial to continue the configuration to ensure the correctness of the configuration.

## something else

### Update subscription

- "Delete all subscription nodes"
- "Save and Subscribe"

:::tip
Because nodes may be adjusted regularly, in order to ensure that the subscribed node information is consistent with the node information provided by the official website, please update the subscription regularly (1~2 weeks). Since Merlin's scientific Internet plug-in does not cover nodes, directly updating subscriptions will cause node sorting to be chaotic. It is recommended to follow the above steps.
