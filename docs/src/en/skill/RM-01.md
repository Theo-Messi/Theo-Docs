title: Getting started with Homebrew
---

## Introduction

Developed by developer Max Howell and based on BSD open source, Homebrew is a very convenient package manager tool. In the early days, Homebrew only had a macOS version. As the number of users increased, Homebrew also provided a Linux version to help developers also use Homebrew to configure the environment on Linux.

## Install Homebrew

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## install software

For example, if we want to install `Nginx`, enter the following command in the terminal below.

```sh
brew install nginx
```

## Search software

1. Use command search

```sh
  brew search [keyword]
```

2. Use web search

<https://formulae.brew.sh/>

## View software information

```sh
brew info [keyword]
```

## View installed software

```sh
brew list
```

## Update installed software

```sh
  brew outdated # View all software with updated versions
  brew upgrade # Update all software
  brew upgrade [software name] #Update a single software
```

## Uninstall an installed package

```sh
  brew uninstall [software name]
```

## View package information

```sh
brew info [software name]
```

## Clean up old versions of software

```sh
brew cleanup # Clean up the historical versions of all software in the system
brew cleanup [software name] # Clean up old versions of specific software
```

## Management background software

Software such as `Nginx`MySQL`has some server software running in the background. If you want to manage these software, you can use the`brew services` command to manage it.

- `brew services list`: View all services
- `brew services run [service name]`: Run a service once
- `brew services start [service name]`: Run a service and set it to run automatically at boot.
- `brew services stop [service name]`: Stop a service
- `brew services restart`: Restart a service.

## Check Hombrew environment

If your Hombrew is not working properly, you can execute `brew doctor` to enable Homebrew's own checks to identify the problems and fix them.

## Update Homebrew

```sh
brew update
```

## Add a new tap

```sh
brew tap [user/repo]
```

## Commonly used taps

When using homebrew, we usually add several common taps to ensure that we have enough software to install.

### Caskroom

Caskroom is a very famous tap under Homebrew. With caskroom, we can install some software with graphical interface, such as VSCode, Typora and other software.

It is also very simple to use. In the latest version of Homebrew, you can directly use `brew cask install [software name]` to install specific software, and homebrew will automatically install Caskroom.

### homebrew-cask-fonts

Programmers inevitably need to install some code fonts so that they can write code better. Homebrew also provides a tap to facilitate us to install fonts.

When using it, you need to add the corresponding tap first, and then execute the installation. For example, if we want to install `source code pro`, we only need to execute the following command.

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-source-code-pro
```

## Switch domestic mirror source

### Use the image of the University of Science and Technology of China

```sh
cd "$(brew --repo)"
git remote set-url origin git://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/brew.git
cd "$(brew --repo)/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core"
git remote set-url origin git://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/homebrew-core.git
```

### Use the image of Tsinghua University

```sh
git -C "$(brew --repo)" remote set-url origin https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/homebrew/brew.git
git -C "$(brew --repo homebrew/core)" remote set-url origin https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/homebrew/homebrew-core.git
```

## Use Brewfile to complete environment migration

After using the device for a long time, there will be a lot of software in our computer. If you need to migrate the environment, reinstalling it will be a big trouble. Fortunately, Homebrew itself provides us with a very easy-to-use environment migration tool - `Homebrew Bundle`

You first need to execute `brew bundle dump` on the previous computer to complete the export of the current environment. After the export is completed, you will get a Brewfile.

Then copy the Brewfile to the new computer and execute `brew bundle` to start the installation process.
