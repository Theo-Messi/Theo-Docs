## Version selection

fancyss 3.0 supports five platforms: hnd, hnd_v8, qca, arm, and mtk. Each platform has a full version and a lite version.

The full version is a full-featured version that supports six clients: SS, SSR, V2ray, Xray, Trojan, and NaÃ¯veProxy. The installation package is larger.

The lite version is a simplified version that supports five clients: SS, SSR, V2ray, Xray, and Trojan. The installation package is compact. The following is the simplified content of the lite version:

1. The lite version removes the v2ray and trojan binaries and uses xray-core to run the v2ray and trojan protocols by default.
2. The lite version removes NaÃ¯veProxy support and its related binaries: naive, ipt2socks
3. The lite version removes the v2ray-plugin plug-in function of shadowsocks and its corresponding binary file: v2ray-plugin
4. The lite version removes the UDP acceleration function and its binaries: speederv1, speederv2, udp2raw
5. The lite version removes the KCP acceleration function and its binary file: kcptun
6. The lite version removes load balancing support and its pages and binaries: haproxy
7. The lite version removes the direct resolution DNS scheme and its binaries: cdns, chinadns, chinadns1, smartdns, https_dns_proxyy
8. The lite version has removed haveged because newer firmware systems now come with entropy increasing software.
9. The lite version removes the function of shadowsocks-rust and replaces shadowsocks-libev. By default, shadowsocks-libev runs the ss protocol.
10. The lite version removes the socks5 page, its script and its acl rule file

If you are a user who does not bother with the above streamlined functions, you can use the smaller lite version.

For models like RT-AX56U_V2 and RT-AX57, which have extremely small jffs partitions (15MB), you can directly use the lite version.

To switch to the lite version, just install the offline installation package of the lite version. Future online updates will also maintain the lite version.

To switch to the full version, simply install the offline installation package of the full version. Future online updates will also maintain the full version.

RT-AX86U, GT-AX6000 and other armv8 models (see the table above), starting from 3.0.6, it is recommended to install the fancyss_hnd_v8 version, of course fancyss_hnd is also compatible

## Plug-in download

There are two ways to download plug-ins:

1. In the `packages` directory, click the tar.gz suffix file to download the latest version of the offline installation package.
2. In the [fancyss_history_package](https://github.com/hq450/fancyss_history_package) project, the offline installation package containing the **historical version** and the **latest version**

## Plug-in installation

1. Offline installation: After downloading and verifying the offline installation package, use the **Offline Installation**/**Manual Installation** function in the software center, select the installation package, upload and install it.

2. Command installation: (Take fancyss_hnd_lite.tar.gz as an example, first download the installation package and upload it to the /tmp directory of the router)

   ```bash
   mv /tmp/fancyss_hnd_lite.tar.gz /tmp/shadowsocks.tar.gz
   tar -zxvf /tmp/shadowsocks.tar.gz
   sh /tmp/shadowsocks/install.sh
   ```

## About skin

Currently the plug-in skin supports the following versions:

asuswrt: classic asuswrt skin

rog: ASUS red rog skin

tuf: ASUS orange tuf skin

tx: ASUS Tianxuan cyan skin

## Precautions

- It is strongly recommended to use a browser with chrome or chrouium kernel! To ensure the best compatibility!
- It is strongly recommended to use fancyss_hnd on the latest version of firmware and the latest version of Software Center!
- The plug-in will automatically follow the skin type of the current firmware and supports three skin types: assuwrt, rog, and tuf.
- Co-branded versions of some models can install this plug-in as long as they have the official/Merlin revised firmware!

## Directory description

1. **fancyss**: Main directory of plug-in code, packaged by build.sh into offline installation packages for different routers
2. **binaries**: Some online updated binary programs, such as v2ray, xray

## Prompt to detect illegal keywords

If it prompts that illegal keywords are detected in the offline installation package name, enable the SSH function of the router, log in and enter the following command, and then perform offline installation. (For arm380/X7.x version firmware, please update the software center to 1.4.8 and above)

```sh
sed -i 's/\tdetect_package/\t# detect_package/g' /koolshare/scripts/ks_tar_install.sh
```

**If you have updated the Merlin 386 revised firmware and the status shows double:x:, please use the offline installation function to overwrite and install the scientific Internet plug-in. **
