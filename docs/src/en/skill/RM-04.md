## Linux directory structure

The directory structure of Linux is a tree structure, and the top-level directory is the root directory `/`.

Other directories can be added to the book by mounting them, and they can be removed by unmounting them.

#### Absolute path and relative path

| **Absolute path**                                                                           | **Relative path**                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Written starting from the root directory `/`, for example: `/usr/share/doc` this directory. | does not start with `/`, for example, when going from `/usr/share/doc` to `/usr/share/man`, you can write: `cd ../man` This is how to write a relative path. |

### View directory

In Linux systems, the `ls` command is probably the most commonly run.

| Command  | Description                                                                           |

| `ls -a`  | List all files, including hidden files (files starting with `.`) (commonly used)      |
| `ls -d`  | Only list the directory itself, not the file data in the directory (commonly used)    |
| `ls -l`  | List long data strings, including file attributes, permissions, etc.; (commonly used) |
| `ll`     | equal to `ls -l`                                                                      |
| `ls -al` | List all files in the directory (including attributes and hidden files)               |

### Switch directory

`cd` is the abbreviation of `Change Directory`, which is the command used to change the working directory.

```bash
cd \[relative path or absolute path\]
```

### Display current directory

`pwd` is the abbreviation of `Print Working Directory`, which is the command to display the current directory.

## Packing and unpacking

Generally, the commonly used compression method on Linux is to use `tar` to package many files into one file, and then use the `gzip` compression command to compress it into a file of `xxx.tat.gz (or xxx.tgz)`.

```bash
tar -cvf xxx.tar #Package
tar -zcvf xxx.tar.gz #Package and compress
tar -xvf xx.tar #Unpacking
tar -zxvf xx.tar.gz -C /usr/my #Unpack and decompress Note -C is capitalized to prevent the path from being found
```

| `-v`       | Display information about the running process       |
| `-f`       | Specify file name                                   |
| `-z`       | Call the `gzip` compression command for compression |
| `-t`       | View the contents of the compressed file            |
| `-x`       | Unpack `tar` file                                   |

## View process snapshot

`ps`:`-aux` displays a snapshot of the current process

View the `Java` process: `ps -aux | grep java`

Check the `MySQL` process: `ps -aux | grep mysql`

## Pipeline

Pipes are an important and commonly used content in Linux. Their function is to use the output of one command as the input of another command and use it in combination.

`ls --help | more`: View help information in pages, press `q` to exit

## VIM Editor

vim is divided into three modes, namely **Command mode**, **Insert mode** and **Last line mode**

### Command mode

The user has just started `vi/vim` and entered the command mode.

Keystrokes in this state will be recognized by `vim` as commands instead of entering characters. For example, if we press `i` at this time, we will not enter a character. `i` is treated as a command.

The following are some commonly used commands:

| Parameters | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `i`        | Switch to input mode to enter characters.                                |
| `x`        | Delete the character at the current cursor position.                     |
| `:`        | Switch to bottom line command mode to enter commands on the lowest line. |

If you want to edit text: Start `vim`, enter command mode, press `i`, switch to input mode.

Command mode only has some of the most basic commands, so you still have to rely on the bottom line command mode to enter more commands.

### Input mode

Pressing `i` in command mode enters input mode. In input mode, the following keys are available:
| Parameters | Description |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
|Character keys and `Shift` combination |Enter characters|
|`ENTER`|Line break|
|`BACK SPACE`|Delete the character before the cursor|
|`DEL`|Delete one character after the cursor|
|`Arrow keys`|Move the cursor in text|
|`HOME/END`|Move the cursor to the beginning/end of the line|
|`Page Up/Page Down`|Page up/down|
|`Insert`|Switch the cursor to input/replace mode, the cursor will become a vertical bar/underline|
|`ESC`|Exit input mode and switch to command mode|

### Bottom line command mode

Press `: (English colon)` in command mode to enter the bottom line command mode.

Bottom line command mode allows you to enter single or multi-character commands, and there are many available commands. Press the `ESC` key to exit the bottom line command mode at any time.
| Parameters | Description |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
|`:w`|Save file|
|`:w!`|If the file attribute is `read-only`, force writing of the file|
|`:q`|Leave vi|
|`:q!`|Use `!` to force leaving without saving the file|
|`:wq`|Leave after saving|
|`:wq!`|Force storage and leave|
|`:set number`|Display line number|
|`:set nonumber`|Cancel line number display|

### File permissions in Linux

Permission management is very strict in the Linux operating system. In the Linux system, not only users and groups are managed according to UID and GID, but also the files in the Linux system are classified according to users and groups, and permissions are managed for different groups, which are used to determine who can pass what permissions. methods and directories to access and operate.

Permissions have a total of 10 characters, and we divide them into 4 parts to understand:

**Indicates the type of file**
|Parameters|Type|
|---|---|
|`-`| means a file|
|`d`| means a directory|
|`l`| means a connection (understood as a shortcut)|

**User Group Type**
|Abbreviation|User Group|Type|
|---|---|---|
|`u`|`owner`| Owner: the permissions the current user has on the file|
| `g`|`group`|Other users in the current group have permissions to the file|
|`o`|`other`|Permissions for this file that users in other groups have | - Permissions for this file that users from other groups have

**Permissions**

- `r`: `Read` read
- `w`: `Write` writes
- `x`: `execute` execution

Add execution permission to the directory, but not to the file (because files with execution permission have security risks)

For files and directories, `r, w, x` have different functions and meanings
||For files|For directories|
|---|---|---|
|`r`|Read file contents|View the file list in the directory|
|`w`|Modify file content|Delete and create files in the directory|
|`x`|Execution permission has no meaning for files other than binary programs|You can cd into the directory, you can view the detailed attributes of the files in the directory, and you can access the contents of the files in the directory (basic permissions)|

:::tip
The root account is not subject to read and write restrictions on file permissions, and execution permissions are restricted.
:::

<table data-draft-node="block" data-draft-type="table" data-size="normal" data-row-style="normal"><tbody><tr><td>Permission items</td><td>File Type</td><td>Read</td><td>Write</td><td>Execute</td><td>Read</td><td>Write</td ><td>Execute</td><td>Read</td><td>Write</td></tr><tr><td>Character representation</td><td>(d|l|c |s|p)</td><td>(r)</td><td>(w)</td><td>(x)</td><td>(r)</td><td>(w)</td><td>(x)</td><td>(r)</td><td>(w)</td></tr><tr><td>Number means</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Permission allocation</td><td></td><td>File owner</td><td>User of the group to which the file belongs</td><td>Other users</td></tr></tbody></table>

The order in which users obtain file permissions: first check whether they are the owners, and if so, the subsequent permissions will not be checked; then check whether they belong to the group to which they belong, and if so, the subsequent permissions will not be checked.

### Modify file permissions

`chown` means `change owner`, and its main function is to change the file or directory owner.
|Parameters|Description|
|---|---|
|`chmod`|Modify the read and write execution attributes of files and folders. Access permissions: `All users` |
|`chown`|Modify user and user group attributes of files and folders. Usage permissions: `root`|

### mode mode

```bash
chmod who opt per file
```

| Parameters | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `who`      | `u g o a(all)` (`u user user`, `g user group group`, `o other users`, `a all users default`) |
| `opt`      | `+`Add a certain permission `-`Cancel a certain permission `=`Grant permission               |
| `per`      | `r w x X`                                                                                    |

Example:

```bash
chmod u=rwx,g=r a.txt
chmod u+x,g+w,o+w test.log #r reads, w writes, x executes
```

### Digital mode

Syntax: `chmod xxx file`
|Parameters|Parameters|Parameters|
|---|---|---|
|`rwx`| `421` |`7`|
|`rw-`| `420`| `6`|
|`r--` |`400` |`4`|

- `0` means no permission,
- `1` means executable `x`,
- `2` means write permission `w`,
- `4` means read permission `r`

**For example:**

```bash
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 10 oct 16 02:55 yhp.log
```

| Permissions            | Parameters | Parameters | Parameters |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| User Permissions       | `rwx`      | `4+2+1`    | `7`        |
| Group permissions      | `r--`      | `4+0+0`    | `4`        |
| Other user permissions | `r--`      | `4+0+0`    | `4`        |

**Combination: 744**

**Modify permissions:**

- Added write permission +2 to both
- Add write permission to user group: +2
- Add executable permissions to other users: +1

**Combination: 765**

```bash
chmod 765 a.txt
```

## Linux common network operations

### Host name operation

- `hostname`: displays the host name
- `hostname XXX`: Modify the host name, not recommended, temporarily effective

To change the host name permanently, you need to modify the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file.

### Query complete system information

```bash
uname -a #Display complete system information
```

### IP address operations

```bash
ip addr # View IP address
vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ # Modify IP address
service network restart # Restart network service
```

### Domain name mapping

```bash
vim /etc/hosts
```

### Network service management

```bash
systemctl stauts network # Check network service status
systemctl start network # Start network service
systemctl stop network # Stop network service
systemctl restart network # Restart network service
systemctl enable network # Set startup
```

###

**9.6, Firewall settings**

```bash
systemctl status firewalld #View firewall status
systemctl start firewalld #Start the firewall
systemctl stop firewalld #Close the firewall
systemctl is-enable firewalld #Check whether the firewall service is started at boot
systemctl enable firewalld #Enable firewall service when booting
systemctl disable firewalld #Disable the firewall service when booting
systemctl list-unit-files|grep enabled #Query the list of started services
systemctl --failed #Query the list of services that failed to start
```
