title: Use nvm to manage different versions of node
---

## The difference between nvm and n

Another node version management tool is TJ's n command. The n command exists as a node module, and nvm is an external shell script independent of node/npm, so the n command is more limited than nvm.

Since the module paths installed by npm are all `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`, when using n to switch different node versions, the global node/npm directory will actually be shared. Therefore, it cannot well meet the requirement of "using different global node modules according to different node versions".

## Uninstall globally installed node/npm

The node installation package downloaded from the official website will be automatically installed in the global directory after running. You often encounter some permission issues during use, so it is recommended to uninstall the globally installed node/npm according to the following method.

First, open your Finder, press shift+command+G, open the window to the folder, enter the following directories and delete the files and folders related to node and node_modules:

- Open `/usr/local/lib` and delete files and folders related to `node` and `node_modules`
- Open `/usr/local/include` and delete files and folders related to `node` and `node_modules`

If you installed NodeJS using `brew install node`, then you also need to execute the `brew uninstall node` command in the terminal to uninstall it.

Check all local, lib and include folders under your personal home folder and delete all files and folders related to node and node_modules

Open /usr/local/bin and delete the node executable

You may also need to enter some additional commands in your terminal:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/npm
sudo rm /usr/local/share/man/man1/node.1
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/dtrace/node.d
sudo rm -rf ~/.npm
sudo rm -rf ~/.node-gyp
sudo rm /opt/local/bin/node
sudo rm /opt/local/include/node
sudo rm -rf /opt/local/lib/node_modules
```

## Install nvm

```bash
brew install nvm
```

## Install multiple versions of node/npm

Install version 4.2.2:

```bash
nvm install 4.2.2
```

Install the latest version of the latest 4.2 series:

```bash
nvm install 4.2
```

List all versions available on the remote server:

```bash
nvm ls-remote
```

## Switch between different versions

Switch to 4.2.2:

```bash
nvm use 4.2.2
```

Switch to 4.2.x:

```bash
nvm use 4.2
```

Switch to the latest version:

```bash
nvm use node
```

## List installed instances

```bash
nvmls
```

## Use different versions of Node in your project

We can specify the Node version to use by creating a `.nvmrc` file in the project directory. Then execute `nvm use` in the project directory.

The content of the `.nvmrc` file only needs to comply with the semantic versioning rules mentioned above.

## Using npm in multiple environments

Each version of Node comes with a different version of npm. You can use `npm -v` to view the npm version. Globally installed npm packages are not shared across different Node environments as this would cause compatibility issues. They are placed in directories of different versions, such as `~/.nvm/versions/node/<version>/lib/node_modules</version>`. This just saves us the effort of using `sudo` in Linux. Because this is the user's home folder, it does not cause permission issues.

But the question is, do we have to reinstall the npm packages we have installed? Fortunately, we have a solution to our problem. Run the following command to import from a specific version of Node to the new version of Node we will install:

```bash
nvm install v5.0.0 --reinstall-packages-from=4.2
```
