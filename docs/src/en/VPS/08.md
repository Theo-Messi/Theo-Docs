## Installation & Upgrade

```sh
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh)
```

### Manual installation & upgrade

1. First download the latest compressed package from https://github.com/vaxilu/x-ui/releases, generally choose the `amd64` architecture
2. Then upload the compressed package to the `/root/` directory of the server, and log in to the server using the `root` user

> If your server CPU architecture is not `amd64`, replace `amd64` in the command with another architecture

```shell
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
```

## Install using docker

### Install docker

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

### Install x-ui

```shell
mkdir x-ui && cd x-ui
docker run -itd --network=host \
     -v $PWD/db/:/etc/x-ui/ \
     -v $PWD/cert/:/root/cert/ \
     --name x-ui --restart=unless-stopped \
     enwaiax/x-ui:latest
```

### Build your own image

```shell
docker build -t x-ui .
```

## SSL certificate application

The script has a built-in SSL certificate application function. To use this script to apply for a certificate, the following conditions must be met:

- Know your Cloudflare registered email address
- Know the Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name has been resolved to the current server through cloudflare

### Method to obtain Cloudflare Global API Key:

`API`-`Get your API Token`-`View Global API Key`

When using it, just enter `domain name`, `email`, `API KEY`

### Precautions

- This script uses DNS API for certificate request
- Use Let'sEncrypt as CA by default
- The certificate installation directory is the /root/cert directory
- The certificates applied for by this script are all pan-domain certificates
