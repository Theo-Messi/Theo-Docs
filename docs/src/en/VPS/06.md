title: Install Nezha panel
---

## Preparation

Before starting, please first determine the domain name where you want to build the probe.

For example, `tz.llxx.cc` is used as the domain name of the panel, and there is `tzz.llxx.cc` used to record the IP of the panel server.

:::tip Preparation work

1. VPS connected to the public network
2. Firewall and security policies need to allow `8008` and `5555` ports
3. Point to the domain name of the server IP and set up the A record
4. Github account
5. Pagoda Panel
6. A domain name
   :::

**Project address: <https://github.com/naiba/nezha>**

## Get Github's Client ID and key

Nezha Monitoring is connected to Github, Gitlab, Jihulab, and Gitee as the backend administrator account

- First we need to create a new verification application, taking Github as an example
- After logging in to Github, open <https://github.com/settings/developers>
- Select "OAuth Apps" - "New OAuth App"
  - `Application name` - fill in whatever you want
  - `Homepage URL` - Fill in the access domain name of the panel, such as: "<http://cdn.example.com>"
  - `Authorization callback URL` - Fill in the callback address, such as: "<http://cdn.example.com/oauth2/callback>"
- Click “Register application”
- Save the Client ID on the page, and then click "Generate a new client secret" to create a new Client Secret. The newly created secret will only be displayed once, please save it properly.
- The application creation entrance of JihuLab is: https://jihulab.com/-/profile/applications
- The callback address should be filled in `Redirect URL`
- Check `read_user` and `read_api` in `Scope` below
- After creation, save the application ID and password

## Install Pagoda

::: code-group

```sh [Centos]
yum install -y wget && wget -O install.sh https://download.bt.cn/install/install_6.0.sh && sh install.sh ed8484bec

## Install monitoring

### Create a new OAuth App

- Open: https://github.com/settings/developers
- Click the New OAuth App button.
- Record the Client ID and Client secrets of OAuth Apps
- Record the client ID and client secret of the OAuth application

### Release port and resolve domain name

Open ports `8088` and `5555` on your server. And resolve two domain names to the server!

### Execute script

::: code-group

```sh [foreign machine]
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naiba/nezha/master/script/install.sh -o nezha.sh && chmod +x nezha.sh && sudo ./nezha.sh
```

```sh [domestic machine]
curl -L https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/naiba/nezha@master/script/install.sh -o nezha.sh && chmod +x nezha.sh && sudo CN=true ./nezha.sh
```

:::

:::tip Wait for Docker to be installed and enter the following values.

- `OAuth provider` - choose one among Github, Gitlab, Jihulab, Gitee
- `Client ID` - previously saved Client ID
- `Client Secret` - previously saved secret
- `username` - Username in the OAuth provider
- `Site Title` - Customize the site title
- `Access Port` - Public access port, customizable, default 8008
- `Agent's communication port` - the communication port between Agent and Dashboard, default 5555
  :::
- After the input is completed, wait for the image to be pulled
  After the installation is complete, if everything is normal, you can access the domain name + port number, such as "[http://cdn.example.com:8008](http://cdn.example.com:8008/)" to view panel
- If you need to run the script again in the future, you can run:

```sh
./nezha.sh
```

## Configure reverse proxy

- Create a new site in the Pagoda panel, fill in the publicly accessible domain name, such as "[http://cdn.example.com](http://cdn.example.com/)", and then click "Settings" to enter the site settings Options, select "Reverse Proxy" - "New Reverse Proxy"
- Customize a proxy name, fill in `http://127.0.0.1` in the "Target URL" below and click "Save"
- Open the "Configuration File" on the right side of the reverse proxy you just created, and replace the configuration file with the following content:

<<< @/code/bt.nginx

- Click "Save"

Now, you should be able to access the panel directly using the domain name, such as: "[http://cdn.example.com](http://cdn.example.com/)"

## Install Agent

Currently, Nezha Monitor supports one-click installation of Agent on Windows and Linux. By following the steps in this document, you can easily deploy it on the server.

### Preparation

You need to set the communication domain name in the management panel in advance. This domain name cannot be connected to CDN. Here we use the example communication domain name "data.example.com" mentioned earlier as a demonstration.
Enter the backend management panel, go to the "Settings" page, fill in the communication domain name in the "Panel server domain name/IP not connected to CDN" item, and then click "Save"

### One-click installation in Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)

- First add a server in the admin panel
- Click the green Linux icon button next to the newly added server and copy the one-click installation command
- Run the copied one-click installation command on the controlled server, wait for the installation to complete, and then return to the Dashboard homepage to check whether the server is online.

### One-click installation in Windows

- First add a server in the admin panel
- Click the green Windows icon button next to the newly added server and copy the one-click installation command
- Go into the Windows server, run PowerShell, and run the copied installation command in PowerShell
- If you encounter confirmation of "Execution Policy Change", please select Y
- Wait for the installation to complete and return to the Dashboard homepage to check whether the server is online

### Other ways to install Agent

- First add a server in the admin panel
- In the controlled server, run the script (for servers located in mainland China, please use mirroring):
  ::: code-group

```sh [foreign machine]
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naiba/nezha/master/script/install.sh -o nezha.sh && chmod +x nezha.sh && sudo ./nezha.sh
```

```sh [domestic machine]
curl -L https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/naiba/nezha@master/script/install.sh -o nezha.sh && chmod +x nezha.sh && sudo CN=true ./nezha.sh
```

- Select "Install Monitoring Agent"
- Enter the communication domain name, such as: "data.example.com"
- Enter the panel communication port (RPC port), default is 5555
