title: One-click script deployment to open ARM machine
---

## Preparation

- VPS (can access the Internet scientifically) recommended system Ubuntu, Debian
- Make sure the VPS port 9527 is open! It can be detected through [here](https://tool.chinaz.com/port)
- Telegram Follow Robot [Inspector R’s Little Assistant](https://t.me/radiance_helper_bot)[Inspector R](https://t.me/agentONE_R)
- Project address: [Click to visit](https://github.com/semicons/java_oci_manage)

## Get VPS INFO

Open `telegram`, find the robot you just followed, send the command `/sart`, and start! (If you have any questions, you can send `/help`)

Enter `/raninfo` in the input box. In order to prevent accidentally touching it, you need to enter it twice. The robot will return two lines of strings. These are the identification of our VPS!

Click "Download Private Key" in the picture above and save it to your local device. You will get a `****.pem` file. This is our API key file. Please keep it safe!

Click Add, and the "Configuration File Preview" window will pop up. We need to record what is inside: "Configuration File Preview"!

## VPS side deployment

### Update and install components

```bash
apt update -y #Debian/Ubuntu command
apt install -y curl tar wget #Debian/Ubuntu command
```

### Linux one-click installation/update

- After running, use `bash sh_java_oci.sh` to restart the operation
- The script did not create the folder. You can manually create the folder for easier management, such as: `mkdir rbot && cd rbot`

```bash
wget -O gz_client_bot.tar.gz https://github.com/semicons/java_oci_manage/releases/latest/download/gz_client_bot.tar.gz && tar -zxvf gz_client_bot.tar.gz --exclude=client_config && tar -zxvf gz_client_bot .tar.gz --skip-old-files client_config && chmod +x sh_client_bot.sh && bash sh_client_bot.sh
```

### Deployment key

After the script is deployed, we need to upload the API key file `****.pem` (or `***.cer`) we just downloaded to the VPS and record the file path.

We need to edit the following VPS file: `/root/client_config`, as shown in the figure below:

After confirming that the configuration file is correct, we execute: `bash sh_client_bot.sh` on the VPS

## R Inspector’s Assistant

Enter `/oracle` (oracle cloud management) in the message bar, as shown in the following figure:

## VPS-bot related commands

```bash
Please enter the corresponding parameters in the configuration file first, and then run the required commands below.

#Start or restart
bash sh_client_bot.sh

#View the log (ctrl + c to exit the log)
tail -f log_r_client.log

# Terminate program
ps -ef | grep r_client.jar | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

#Uninstall the program
rm -rf gz_client_bot.tar.gz client_config r_client.jar sh_client_bot.sh log_r_client.log debug-.log
If you don’t need JDK, you can also uninstall it: apt-get remove openjdk*

```
